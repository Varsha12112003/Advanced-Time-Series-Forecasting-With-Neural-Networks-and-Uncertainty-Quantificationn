# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Neural Networks and Uncertainty Quantification

This repository contains a structured starter project for the advanced time series forecasting assignment:
- A readable technical **report** (report.md)
- Example **PyTorch** model skeleton implementing an LSTM with Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty
- Example training loop (train_sample.py)
- Requirements to reproduce the environment
- The original project image included in `data/`

**Files**
- `report.md` — technical write-up with modeling choices, uncertainty quantification approaches, metrics and evaluation plan.
- `model.py` — modular PyTorch model (LSTM + dropout + quantile head skeleton).
- `train_sample.py` — example training & evaluation loop (toy data).
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `notebooks/placeholder.ipynb` — notebook stub for experiments.
- `data/project_description.png` — original uploaded project image.
